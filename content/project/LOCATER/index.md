title: LOCATER
summary: LOCATER explores the data cleaning challenges that arise in using WiFi connectivity data to locate users to semantic indoor locations such as buildings, regions, rooms. LOCATER, has been deployed in more than 30 buildings in 3 universities (UCI, BSU, Plaksha University in India)  and an elderly living facility, Walnut Village, located in Orange County. The system, which has been in operation for over 3 years at UC, Irvine uses data cleaning technologies over WiFi events to locate people inside buildings. It is a practical solution to passive, server-side, indoor localization that leverages existing infrastructure (and hence has zero cost), yet it achieves roughly 85% accuracy which is similar to that achieved by expensive dedicated hardware based solutions available commercially today. See our [demo]('https://tippersweb.ics.uci.edu/covid19/d/UUeKIMPMz/engineering-occupancy-counts?orgId=1&from=now-24h&to=now') for one location-based application, occupancy, which is built using LOCATER.

description: LOCATER has been applied in several real-world applications, such as T-COVE project including real-time occupancy and contact tracing, and has been deployed in UCI and BSU campuses over 30+ buildings since 2020.  The technical paper of LOCATER appears in PVLDB 2021, volumn 13, page 329â€“341. Please check the following links to see our real-world applications that are being used in UCI and BSU built based on LOCATER.
