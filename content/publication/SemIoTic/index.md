abstract: This demonstration showcases the SemIoTic middleware which provides inhabitants of an IoT space, as well as developers of applications, with a semantic view of the space. Participants will have an opportunity to see how useful IoT applications can be easily developed focusing on describing what information is needed without having to deal with the underlying IoT device infrastructure.
