title: Auto-BI
summary: Auto-BI helps end-users by accurately predicting BI models given a set of input tables by developing a principled graph-based optimization problem in Auto-BI that considers both local join prediction and global schema-graph structures. Extensive experiments on 1000 real test cases suggest that Auto-BI is both efficient and accurate, achieving over 90% F1-score when evaluated against ground-truth BI models that humans design.
